# Benchmarks-Isabelle2Cpp
To benchmark C++ codes that generated from Isabelle2Cpp.

The files c_peter, imp, sml, llvm of bs are download 
from https://github.com/lammich/isabelle_llvm.git,
which created by peter lammich.

The go generator is download from 
https://github.com/isabelle-prover/isabelle-go-codegen.git.
